# AgentBaseSimulation-Pandemic-Economy
Python implementation of agent based simulation of pandemic and economy with manimGL visualization.

This implementation is mainly based on COVID-ABS:
(1) The paper : [COVID-ABS: An agent-based model of COVID-19 epidemic to simulate health and economic effects of social distancing interventions(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920304859])
(2) The Github repo [petroniocandido->COVID19_AgentBasedSimulation](https://github.com/petroniocandido/COVID19_AgentBasedSimulation)
